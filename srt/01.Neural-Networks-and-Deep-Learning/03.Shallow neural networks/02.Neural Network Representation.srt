00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,689
neural network in this video we'll talk
在这次课中我们将讨论

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,759
about exactly what those pictures means
这些图片的具体含义

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,919
in other words exactly what those little
换句话说就是我们画的这些

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,530
neural networks have been drawing on
神经网络的图片

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,660
represent and we'll starts with focusing
到底代表什么 我们首先关注

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,400
on the case of neural networks with
一个例子 本例中的神经网络

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,470
what's called a single hidden layer
只包含一个隐含层

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,990
here's a picture of a neural network let's
这是一张神经网络的图片

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,939
give different parts of these pictures
让我们给此图的不同部分

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,210
some names we have the input features x1
取一些名字 我们有输入特征x1

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,420
x2 x3 stacked vertically and this is
x2 x3 它们被竖直地堆叠起来

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,390
called the input layer of the neural
这叫做神经网络的输入层

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,030
network so maybe not surprisingly this
所以没什么好奇怪的

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,649
contains the inputs to the neural
它包含了神经网络的输入

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,100
network then there's another layer of
然后这里有另外一层

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,440
circles and this is called a hidden
我们称之为隐藏层

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,480
layer of the neural network I'll come
待会儿我会

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,340
back in a second to say what the word
回过头来讲解术语"隐藏"

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,739
hidden means but the final layer here is
的意义 但是这里最后一层

21
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,260
formed by in this case just one node and
在本例中 只由一个结点构成

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,379
this single note layer is called the
而这个只有一个结点的层

23
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,090
output layer and it's responsible for
被称为输出层 它负责

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,210
generating the predicted value y hat in
产生预测值y帽

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,250
a neural network the you train with
在一个神经网络中 当你使用

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,050
supervised learning the training set
监督学习训练它的时候 训练集

27
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,750
contains values of the inputs x as well
包含了输入x 也包含了

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,210
as the target outputs y so the term
目标输出y 所以术语

29
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,549
hidden layer refers to the fact that in
隐藏层的含义是 事实上

30
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,950
a training set the true values for these
在训练集中 这些中间结点的

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,780
nodes in the middle are not observed
准确值我们是看不到的

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,610
that is you don't see what they should be
也就是说你看不见它们

33
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,049
in the training set you see what the
在训练集中应具有的值 你能看见

34
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,369
inputs are you see what the output
输入的值 你也能看见输出的值

35
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,170
should be but the things in a hidden
但是隐藏层中的东西

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,299
layer are not seen in the training set
在训练集中你是无法看到的

37
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,090
so that kind of explains the name hidden
所以这也解释了词语隐藏层

38
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,950
layer just means you don't see it in a
只是表示你无法在

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,720
training set let's introduce a bit more
训练集中看到他们 现在我们再引入

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,850
notation where as previously we were
几个符号 就像之前

41
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,030
using the vector x to denote the input
我们用向量x表示输入特征

42
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,390
features an alternative notation for the
这里有个可代替的记号

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,720
values of the input features will be a
可以用来表示输入特征

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,729
superscript square bracket 0 and the
我们用a上标[0]来表示

45
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,579
term a also stands for activations and
而这个a也表示激活的意思

46
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,790
it refers to the values that different
它意味着网络中不同层

47
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,829
layers of the neural network are passing
的值会传递到它们

48
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,619
on to the subsequent layers so the input
后面的层中 所以输入层

49
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,229
layer passes on the value x to the
将x的值传递给

50
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,820
hidden layer so we're going to call that
隐藏层 所以我们将

51
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,850
call the activations of the input layer a
输入层的激活值称为a上标[0]

52
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,700
superscript 0 the next layer the hidden
下一层即隐藏层

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,189
layer will in turn generate some set of
也同样会产生一些激活值

54
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,290
activations which I'm going to write as
那么我将其记作

55
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,319
a superscript square bracket 1 so
a上标[1] 所以

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,220
in particular this first unit or this first node
具体地 这里的第一个单元或结点

57
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,800
we generate the value a superscript
我们将其表示为

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,980
square bracket 1 subscript 1 this second
a上标[1]下标1 第二个结点

59
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,530
node we generate the value now with a
的值我们记为

60
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,060
subscript 2 and so on
a上标[1]下标2 以此类推

61
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,910
and so a superscript square bracket 1
所以这里的a上标[1]

62
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,480
this is a four dimensional vector or if
是一个四维的向量

63
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,130
you write it in Python it gives us a four
如果写成Python代码 那么它是一个

64
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,040
by one matrix or four column vector
规模为4x1的矩阵或一个大小为4的列向量

65
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,930
which looks like this and it's four
就像我画的这样 它是四维的

66
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,850
dimensional because in this case we have
是因为在本例中 我们有

67
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,540
four nodes or four units or four hidden
四个结点 或者单元 或者称为四个

68
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,120
units in this hidden layer then finally
隐藏层单元 最后

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,950
the output layer will generate some
输出层将产生

70
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,410
value a two which is just a real number
某个数值a 它只是一个单独的实数

71
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,980
and so y hat is going to take on the
所以y帽的值将

72
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,410
value of a 2 so this is analogous to how
取为a上标[2] 所以这和

73
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,540
in logistic regression we have y hat
逻辑回归是相似的 我们有y帽

74
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,720
equals a and in logistic regression
直接等于a 在逻辑回归中

75
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,480
we only had that one output layer so we
我们只有一个输出层

76
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,950
didn't use the superscript square
所以我们没有用带方括号的上标

77
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,140
bracket but with a neural network we're
但是在神经网络中

78
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,880
now going to use this superscript square
我们将使用这种带上标的形式

79
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,010
bracket to explicitly indicate which
来明确地指出这些值

80
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,760
layer it came from one funny thing about
来自哪一层 有趣的是

81
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,410
notational conventions in neural networks
在约定俗成的符号传统中

82
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,269
is that this network that you're seeing
在这里你看到的这个例子

83
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,850
here is called a two layer neural
只能叫做一个两层的

84
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,910
network and the reason is that when we
神经网络 原因是当我们

85
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,010
count layers in neural networks we don't
计算网络的层数时 输入层

86
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,200
count the input layer so the hidden
不算进总的层数内 所以隐藏层

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,840
layer is layer 1 and the output layer is
是第一层 输出层

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,150
layer two another notational convention
是第二层 第二个惯例是

89
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,580
we're calling the input layer layer 0 so
我们将输入层称为第零层

90
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,470
technically maybe there are three layers
所以在技术上 这任是一个三层的

91
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,420
in this neural network because this is
神经网络 因为

92
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,620
input layer the hidden layer and the
这里有输入层 隐藏层 还有

93
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,260
output layer but in conventional users if
输出层 但是在传统的符号使用者中

94
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,510
you read research papers and also in the
如果你阅读研究论文 或者

95
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,310
course you see people refer to this
在这门课中 你会看到人们将

96
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,470
particular neural network as a two layer
这个神经网络称为一个

97
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,540
neural network because we don't count input
两层的神经网络 因为我们不将

98
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,400
layer as a as an official layer
输入层看作一个标准的层

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,230
finally something that we'll get to
之后我们要看到的是

100
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,330
later is that the hidden layer and the
隐藏层以及

101
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,580
output layers will have parameters
最后的输出层

102
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,590
associated with it so the hidden layer
是带有参数的 这里的隐藏层

103
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,360
will have associated with their
将拥有两个参数

104
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,930
parameters w and b and I'm going to write
w和b 我将给它们加上

105
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,030
superscript square bracket 1 to indicate
上标[1] 表示这些参数

106
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,040
that these are parameters associated
是和第一层有关系的

107
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,140
with layer 1 with a hidden layer we'll
即和隐藏层有关系

108
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,140
see later that w will be a 4 by 3
之后我们会看到w是一个4x3

109
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,979
matrix and b will be a 4 by 1 vector in
的矩阵 而b是一个4x1的向量

110
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,780
this example where the first coordinate
在这个例子中 第一个数字4

111
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,820
4 comes from the fact that we have four
源自于我们有四个

112
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,490
nodes or four hidden units
结点或隐藏层单元

113
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,590
there and three comes from the fact that
然后数字3源自于

114
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,870
we have three input features we'll talk
这里有三个输入特征

115
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,580
later about the dimensions of these
我们之后会更加详细地讨论这些

116
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,470
matrices and it might make more sense at
矩阵的规模 到那时你可能

117
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,810
that time but in similarly the output
就更加清楚了 相似的

118
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,729
layer has associated with it also
输出层也有一些

119
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,819
parameters w superscript square bracket
与之关联的参数w上标[2]

120
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,520
2 and b superscript square bracket 2 and
以及b上标[2]

121
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,199
in terms of the dimensions of these are
从规模上来看 它们的规模

122
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,630
one by four and one by one and this one
分别是1x4以及1x1 这个1x4

123
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,759
by fours because the hidden layer has
是因为隐藏层

124
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,710
four hidden units the output layer has
有四个隐藏层单元而输出层

125
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,780
just one unit and we're going we'll go over
只有一个单元 之后我们会

126
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,490
the dimensions of these matrices and
对这些矩阵和向量的维度

127
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,220
vectors in a later video so you've just
做更加深入的解释

128
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,470
seen what a two layer neural network
所以你现在已经知道一个两层的神经网络

129
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,509
looks like that is a neural network with
什么样的了 它是一个只有一个隐藏层

130
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,180
one hidden layer in the next video let's
的神经网络 在下一个视频中

131
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,340
go deeper into exactly what this neural
我们将更深入地了解这个神经网络

132
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,009
network is computing that is how this
是如何进行计算的 也就是

133
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,229
neural network inputs x and goes all the
这个神经网络是怎么输入x

134
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:15,599
way to computing this output y hat
然后又是怎么得到y帽的
