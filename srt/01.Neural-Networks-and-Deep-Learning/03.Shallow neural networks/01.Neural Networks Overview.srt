00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,100
it we'll delve in the technical details
我们将在后面的几个视频中

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,680
in the next few videos but for now let's
深入讨论技术细节 现在我们

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,660
give a quick overview of how you
开始快速浏览一下如何

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,269
implement in your network last week we
实现神经网络

12
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,250
had talked about logistic regression and
上周我们讨论了logistic回归

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,300
we saw how this model corresponds to the
我们了解了这个模型如何

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,430
following computation graph where you
与下面这个计算图建立联系

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,520
need to put the features X and parameters
你需要输入特征X

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,370
w and b that allows you to compute z which
参数w和b 然后你就可以计算出z

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,620
is then used to compute a and we were
接下来使用z计算出a

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,219
using a interchangeably with this output
我们将a的符号换为表示输出的y^

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,190
Y hat and then you can compute the loss
接下来计算损失函数l

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,059
function l a neural network looks like this
神经网络就是这个样子

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,920
and as I'd already previously alluded
我之前已经提到过了

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,930
you can form a neural network by
你可以把

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,239
stacking together a lot of little
许多sigmoid单元堆叠起来

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,420
sigmoid units whereas previously this
形成一个神经网络

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,969
node corresponds to two steps of
这个节点包含了之前讲的计算的两个步骤

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,920
calculations the first three compute the
首先 计算出z值

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,680
z value second is it computes this a
然后计算a值

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,640
value in this neural network this stack of
这个神经网络中

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,549
notes will correspond to a Z like
这些节点首先

30
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,880
calculation like this as well as an a
像这样计算z

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,720
like calculation like that and then that
接着像这样计算a

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,090
node will correspond to another Z and
这个节点同样

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,790
another a like calculation so the
计算了z和a

34
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,040
notation which we should use later will
因此 我们稍后会使用

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,000
look like this
下面这些记号

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,759
first what inputs the features X
首先 X表示输入特征

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,430
together with some parameters W and b
W和b是参数

38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,320
and this will allow you to compute z1 so
通过这些计算出z1

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,930
new notation that one should use is that
我们会使用新的符号

40
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,600
we'll use a superscript square bracket 1
上标 方括号 1

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,689
to refer to quantities associated with
表示与这些节点相关的数

42
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,759
this stack of nodes called a layer and
这些节点被称为一层

43
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,579
then later we'll use superscript square
我们用上标

44
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,280
bracket 2 to refer to quantities
方括号 2 表示

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,920
associated with that really that's
和这个节点相关的数

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,200
called another layer of the network and
这是网络的另一个层

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,140
the superscript square brackets like we
我们这里使用的上标方括号

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,719
have here are not to be confused with
不会和我们之前用来表示

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,319
the superscript round brackets which we
单个的训练样本的

50
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,390
used to refer to individual training
上标圆括号混淆

51
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,080
examples so whereas X
就是说我使用

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,300
supersu round bracket I referred to the
X上标圆括号表示

53
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,030
Ith trained example superscript square
第i个训练样本

54
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,340
bracket 1 and 2 refers to these
上标方括号1 2

55
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,570
different layers layer 1 and layer 2
表示不同的层 这是网络的第一层

56
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,600
in this network but they're going on
这是第二层

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,860
after computing z1 similar to logistic
类似logistic回归

58
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,350
regression there will be a computation
在计算了z1后

59
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,000
to compute a1 and that's just some
需要使用sigmoid(z1)计算a1

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,550
sigmoid of z1 and then you compute z2
接下来你需要使用

61
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,270
using another linear equation and then
另外一个线性方程计算z2

62
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,610
compute a2 and a2 is the final output
接着计算a2 a2就是整个神经网络

63
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,370
of the neural network and will also be
最终的输出

64
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,890
used interchangeably with Y hat so I
我用y^表示网络的输出

65
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,390
know there was a lot of details but the
我知道其中有很多细节

66
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,730
key intuition to take away is that
有一点非常难以理解

67
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,460
whereas for logistic regression we had
logistic回归中

68
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,220
this z followed by a calculation and
z后面直接计算a

69
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,590
this neural network here we just do it
而这个神经网络中

70
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,780
multiple times as a z followed by a
我们只是反复的计算z

71
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,390
calculation and a z followed by a
然后计算a 然后又计算z 然后又计算a

72
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,959
calculation and then you finally compute
最后你得到了最终的输出

73
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,600
the loss at the end and you remember
你应该记得

74
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,670
that for the logistic regression we had in
在logistic中

75
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,959
some backward calculation in order to
有一些从后向前的计算

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,970
compute derivatives they computing
用来计算导数

77
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,750
da dz and so on so in the same way in
da dz等 同样

78
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,580
a neural network we'll end up doing a
在神经网络中

79
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,860
backward calculation that looks like
我们也有从后向前的计算

80
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,910
this and we jump you end up computing
看起来就像这样

81
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,890
da2 dz2 that allows you to compute so
你把da2 dz2计算出来之后

82
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:57,850
dw2 db2 and so on in this order the right
才能计算dw2 db2等

83
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,090
to left backward calculation that is
按红色箭头表示的那样

84
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,020
denoting with the red arrows
从右到左反向计算

85
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,970
So that's quick overview of what a neural network
刚才只是带你大概了解了一下神经网络

86
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,770
looks like but we take the logistic
大概是什么样子的 我们把logistic回归

87
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,950
regression and repeating it twice I know
重复两次

88
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,630
there was a lot of new notation lot of
我清楚多了很多新的符号

89
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,880
new details don't worry about to get and
新的细节 不用担心如果你没有理解

90
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,980
follow everything we'll go into the
在接下来的视频中

91
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,900
details most slowly in the next few
我们会仔细的讨论具体细节

92
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,820
videos so let's go on to the next video
继续看下一个视频吧

93
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,620
we'll stop to talk about the neural
我们将会开始讨论

94
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,850
network representation
神经网络的表示
