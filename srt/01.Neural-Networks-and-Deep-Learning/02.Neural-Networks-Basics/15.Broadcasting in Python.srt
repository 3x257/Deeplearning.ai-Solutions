1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,240
In the previous video, I mentioned that broadcasting
在之前的视频中 我提到了广播(broadcasting)

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,040
is another technique that you can use
to make your Python code run faster.
这是另外一种使你的python代码运行得更快的技术

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,860
In this video, let's delve into how
broadcasting in Python actually works.
现在我们将深入了解它的broadcasting具体是如何工作的

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,240
Let's suppose today broadcasting with an example.
让我们用一个例子引出今天要讲的broadcasting

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,730
In this matrix, I've shown the number
of calories from carbohydrates,
这个矩阵中展示了4种不同食物 以及每100g食物中的

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,320
proteins, and fats in 100 grams of four different foods.
碳水化合物 蛋白质和脂肪中含有的卡路里

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,380
So for example, a 100 grams of apples turns out,
例如 每100g苹果

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,690
has 56 calories from carbs, and
much less from proteins and fats.
有56卡路里来自碳水化合物
蛋白质和脂肪中仅含有很少卡路里

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,110
Whereas, in contrast, a 100 grams of
beef has 104 calories from protein and
相反，100g牛肉的蛋白质中含有104卡路里

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,620
135 calories from fat.
脂肪中含有135卡路里

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,330
Now, let's say your goal is to
calculate the percentage of calories
你的任务是分别计算这四种食物的

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,440
from carbs, proteins and fats for each of the four foods.
碳水化合物、蛋白质和脂肪产生的卡路里的百分比

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,338
So, for example, if you look at this column and
我们以这一列为例

14
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:57,697
add up the numbers in that column
you get that 100 grams of apple
把该列所有数字加起来 你会发现每100g苹果

15
00:00:57,697 --> 00:01:02,580
has 56 plus 1.2 plus 1.8 so that's 59 calories.
56+1.2+1.8 有59卡路里

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,806
And so as a percentage the percentage of
下来算百分比

17
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:11,800
calories from carbohydrates in an apple would
苹果的碳水化合物所产生的卡路里

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,932
be 56 over 59, that's about 94.9%.
占56/59 大约是94.9%

19
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:22,399
So most of the calories in an apple
come from carbs, whereas in contrast,
因此苹果的卡路里主要来自碳水化合物

20
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:27,630
most of the calories of beef come
from protein and fat and so on.
相反 牛肉的卡路里主要来自蛋白质和脂肪

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,630
So the calculation you want is really
to sum up each of the four columns
你需要做的运算就是把这个矩阵的4列数字分别加起来

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,740
of this matrix to get the total number
of calories in 100 grams of apples,
得到100g苹果

23
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,920
beef, eggs, and potatoes.
牛肉、鸡蛋、土豆总共含有的卡路里

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,090
And then to divide throughout the matrix,
然后对整个矩阵做除法运算

25
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,230
so as to get the percentage of
calories from carbs, proteins and
得到四种食物的碳水化合物 蛋白质 脂肪

26
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,870
fats for each of the four foods.
分别产生卡路里的百分比

27
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:01,370
So the question is, can you do
this without an explicit for-loop?
问题是 你可以不用for循环完成么

28
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,290
Let's take a look at
how you could do that.
我们看一下你可以怎么实现

29
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,602
What I'm going to do is
show you how you can set,
我接下来向你展示如何解决该问题

30
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:12,990
say this matrix equal to
three by four matrix A.
让这个矩阵等于一个3*4的矩阵A

31
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,300
And then with one line of Python code
we're going to sum down the columns.
接下来我们用一行Python代码把矩阵按列加起来

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,078
So we're going to get four numbers
corresponding to the total number
我们将得到4个数字 表示这四种食物

33
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:25,046
of calories in these four
different types of foods,
所含卡路里总数

34
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:28,095
100 grams of these four
different types of foods.
100g 四种不同的食物

35
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:32,113
And I'm going to use a second line
of Python code to divide each of
我接下来会用第二行Python代码将四列分别除以

36
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:35,390
the four columns by
their corresponding sum.
他们对应的总和

37
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,250
If that verbal description
wasn't very clearly,
如果口头表述还不够清楚的话

38
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,670
hopefully it will be clearer in a second
when we look in the Python code.
希望我们可以通过Python代码表述清楚

39
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,460
So here we are in the Jupyter notebook.
我们打开Jupyter notebook

40
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,150
I've already written this first
piece of code to prepopulate
我已经写好了第一段代码

41
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,860
the matrix A with the numbers we had
just now, so we'll hit shift enter and
将我们之前给出的数值存入矩阵A 我们按下shift enter

42
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,220
just run that, so there's the matrix A.
运行代码 就有了矩阵A

43
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,080
And now here are the two
lines of Python code.
接下来是两行Python代码

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,983
First, we're going to compute
cal = A.sum(axis=0).
首先 我们计算cal = A.sum(axis=0)

45
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:02,280
And axis equals 0 means to sum vertically.
axis=0表示纵向求和

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,280
We'll say more about that in a little bit.
我们稍后会更细致的讨论

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,076
And then print cal.
然后打印cal

48
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:07,825
So we've sum vertically.
我们已经纵向的把他们加起来了

49
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:13,735
Now 59 is the total number of
calories in the apple, 239 was
59是苹果总共含有的卡路里

50
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:19,575
the total number of calories in the beef
and the eggs and potato and so on.
239是牛肉总共含有的卡路里 后面是鸡蛋 土豆

51
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:25,151
And then with a compute
接下来计算

52
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:30,733
percentage = A/cal.reshape(1,4).

53
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:33,927
Actually we want percentages,
so multiply by 100 here.
我们想要的是百分比，因此这里乘100

54
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:38,860
And then let's print percentage.
然后我们打印percentage

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,950
Let's run that.
运行

56
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,870
And so that command we've taken the matrix A and
我们用这条指令把矩阵A除以

57
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,820
divided it by this one by four matrix.
这个1*4的矩阵

58
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,672
And this gives us
the matrix of percentages.
我们得到了这个百分比矩阵

59
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:57,327
So as we worked out kind of by
hand just now in the apple there
就像我之前手算的苹果那样

60
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:02,480
was a first column 94.9% of
the calories are from carbs.
94.9%的卡路里都来自碳水化合物

61
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go back to the slides.
我们回到幻灯片

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,310
So just to repeat the two
lines of code we had,
重复一下我们写的两行代码

63
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,940
this is what have written
out in the Jupyter notebook.
这是我们在Jupyter notebook中写的

64
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,306
To add a bit of detail this parameter,
讨论一下关于这个参数的一些细节

65
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:18,540
(axis = 0), means that you
want Python to sum vertically.
(axis=0)表示你希望Python纵向求和

66
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,567
So if this is axis 0 this
means to sum vertically,
axis 0意味着纵向相加

67
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,029
whereas the horizontal axis is axis 1.
相反 横向是axis 1

68
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:28,050
So be able to write axis 1 or sum
horizontally instead of sum vertically.
所以 可以写axis 1横向求和

69
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,670
And then this command here,
这是代码

70
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,210
this is an example of Python
broadcasting where you take a matrix A.
这是一个Python broadcasting的例子 你有一个矩阵A

71
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:43,330
So this is a three by four matrix and
you divide it by a one by four matrix.
矩阵A是一个3*4的矩阵 你用它除以一个1*4的矩阵

72
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,370
And technically, after this first
line of codes cal, the variable cal,
严格来说 在第一行代码之后 变量cal

73
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,590
is already a one by four matrix.
已经是一个1*4的矩阵了

74
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,616
So technically you don't need
to call reshape here again, so
所以严格来说 你不需要在这里再次调用reshape

75
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,722
that's actually a little bit redundant.
这事实上有一点冗余

76
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:59,140
But when I'm writing Python codes if
I'm not entirely sure what matrix,
但是如果我在写Python代码的时候并不完全确定矩阵的维度

77
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,056
what what the dimensions of a matrix I often
would just call a reshape command just to
我通常会调用reshape指令

78
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:07,833
make sure that it's the right
column vector or the row vector or
确保这是一个合适的列向量或者行向量

79
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,500
whatever you want it to be.
或者你想要的维度

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,840
The reshape command is a constant time.
reshape指令仅需常量时间

81
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,150
It's a order one operation
that's very cheap to call.
调用他并不会开销并不大

82
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,404
So don't be shy about using the reshape
command to make sure that your matrices
所以调用reshape不用为难 确保你的矩阵

83
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:20,830
are the size you need it to be.
是你需要的尺寸

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,272
Now, let's explain in greater detail how
this type of operation works, right?
下来 我们解释这一操作更多的细节

85
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:33,780
We had a three by four matrix and
we divided it by a one by four matrix.
我们有一个3*4的矩阵 我们用它除以1*4的矩阵

86
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,840
So, how can you divide a three by
four matrix by a one by four matrix?
我们如何让一个3*4的矩阵除以1*4的矩阵呢？

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,860
Or by one by four vector?
或者说1*4的向量

88
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,160
Let's go through a few more
examples of broadcasting.
让我们继续看几个broadcasting的例子

89
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,920
If you take a 4 by 1 vector and
add it to a number, what
如果你有一个4*1的向量 给他加一个数

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,011
Python will do is take this number and auto-expand
Python会自动的将这个数

91
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:58,180
it into a four by one vector as well, as follows.
扩展成为一个4*1的向量 例如

92
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,257
And so the vector [1, 2, 3, 4]
向量[1, 2, 3, 4]

93
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:04,450
plus the number 100 ends up
with that vector on the right.
加上数字100 得到右边那个向量

94
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,280
You're adding a 100 to every element,
and in fact we use this form of
你给每个数字都加了100 事实上我们在之前的视频中

95
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,365
broadcasting where that constant was
the parameter b in an earlier video.
使用了这种形式的broadcasting 那个视频的常数是b

96
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:19,414
And this type of broadcasting works with
both column vectors and row vectors,
这种类型的broadcasting同样适用与行向量和列向量

97
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:24,157
and in fact we use a similar form of
broadcasting earlier with the constant
事实上 在之前logistic回归的视频中我们使用了类似形式的

98
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:29,330
we've added to a vector being
the parameter b in logistic regression.
broadcasting 我们在加法中使用了向量化的参数b

99
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,610
Here's another example.
下面是另一个例子

100
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,900
Let's say you have a two
by three matrix and
假设你有一个2*3的矩阵

101
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,420
you add it to this one by n matrix.
你给它加上这个1*n的矩阵

102
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,682
So the general case would be if you
更一般的情况是 如果你有一个

103
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:50,583
have some (m,n) matrix here and
(m*n)的矩阵

104
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:55,330
you add it to a (1,n) matrix.
你给它加上(1*n)的矩阵

105
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,667
What Python will do is copy the matrix m,
Python将会拷贝这个矩阵m次

106
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:03,672
times to turn this into m by n matrix, so instead of this one by
将这个矩阵变为m*n的矩阵 来看这个1*3的矩阵

107
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:09,980
three matrix it'll copy it twice in
this example to turn it into this.
在这个例子中 他会被拷贝两次 变成这个样子

108
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,092
Also, two by three matrix and
we'll add these so
这是2*3的矩阵 我们把他们加起来

109
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:18,270
you'll end up with the sum on the right, okay?
你将会得到右边的结果

110
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,583
So you taken, you added 100 to the first column,
你给第一列加100

111
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:25,812
added 200 to second column, added 300 to the third column.
第二列加200 第三列加300

112
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,796
And this is basically what we did on the previous slide,
这基本上就是我们在上一张幻灯片做的操作

113
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:32,810
except that we use a division operation
instead of an addition operation.
只是我们使用了除法而不是加法

114
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,402
So one last example,
whether you have a (m,n) matrix and
最后一个例子 如果你有一个(m*n)的矩阵

115
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:46,260
you add this to a (m,1) vector,
(m,1) matrix.
和这个(m*1)的向量相加

116
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,760
Then just copy this n times horizontally.
就将这个横向拷贝n次

117
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,510
So you end up with an (m,n) matrix.
你最后得到一个(m*n)的矩阵

118
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,990
So as you can imagine you copy
it horizontally three times.
你可以想象你横向拷贝了他三次

119
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,650
And you add those.
然后把这两个矩阵加起来

120
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,070
So when you add them you end up with this.
你把他们加起来 会得到这个

121
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,890
So we've added 100 to the first row and
added 200 to the second row.
我们给第一行加了100 第二行加了200

122
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,061
Here's the more general principle
of broadcasting in Python.
关于Python中broadcasting更一般的原理

123
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:17,353
If you have an (m,n) matrix and you add or
如果你有一个(m*n)的矩阵 你把他和

124
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:24,409
subtract or multiply or
divide with a (1,n) matrix,
一个(1*n)的矩阵做四则运算

125
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:31,177
then this will copy it m
times into an (m,n) matrix.
就会把这个(1*n)的矩阵拷贝m次成为一个(m*n)的矩阵

126
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,781
And then apply the addition,
subtraction, and
然后再在元素层面应用加法 减法

127
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,140
multiplication of division elementwise.
乘法 除法等等

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,250
If conversely, you were to take the (m,n)
matrix and add, subtract, multiply,
相反 你有一个(m*n)的矩阵和一个(m*1)的矩阵

129
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:49,060
divide by an (m,1) matrix,
then also this would copy it now n times.
做四则运算 (m*1)的矩阵会被拷贝n次

130
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,740
And turn that into an (m,n) matrix and
then apply the operation elementwise.
变成一个(m*n)的矩阵再在元素层级做运算

131
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,327
Just one of the broadcasting,
which is if you have an (m,1) matrix,
如果你有一个(m*1)的矩阵

132
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:05,175
so that's really a column vector
like [1,2,3], and you add,
比如一个具体的列向量[1,2,3] 你把他和一个

133
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:08,482
subtract, multiply or
divide by a real number.
实数做四则运算

134
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,080
So maybe a (1,1) matrix.
也可能是(1*1)的矩阵

135
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,117
So such as that plus 100,
then you end up copying
例如 加上100 然后你拷贝

136
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:23,512
this real number n times until you'll
also get another (n,1) matrix.
这个实数n次得到一个(n*1)的矩阵

137
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:29,700
And then you perform the operation such
as addition on this example element-wise.
然后你在元素层级做运算 例如加法

138
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,823
And something similar also works for row vectors.
类似的 行向量也是以类似的方式运行

139
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:43,730
The fully general version of broadcasting
can do even a little bit more than this.
完整的broadcasting还有更多形式

140
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,080
If you're interested you can read the documentation for
如过你对此感到很有兴趣 你可以在

141
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,240
NumPy, and look at broadcasting in that documentation.
NumPy的文档中继续研究broadcasting

142
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,380
That gives an even slightly more general definition of broadcasting.
文档给了broadcasting更通用的定义

143
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,140
But the ones on the slide are the main
forms of broadcasting that you end up
但是讲义上的是你在实现

144
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,560
needing to use when you
implement a neural network.
神经网络的过程中需要的形式

145
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,840
Before we wrap up,
just one last comment, which is for
我们结束之前 最后一点说明

146
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,210
those of you that are used to
programming in either MATLAB or
如果你使用过MATLAB或

147
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,760
Octave, if you've ever used the MATLAB or
Octave function bsxfun
Octave 如果你使用过他们的一个函数bsxfun

148
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,590
in neural network programming bsxfun does
something similar, not quite the same.
在神经网络编程中 bsxfun的效果与这个很相似但不完全相同

149
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,750
But it is often used for similar purpose
as what we use broadcasting in Python for.
但它和我们在python中使用广播的目的是类似的

150
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,505
But this is really only for very advanced MATLAB and
这真的是只针对高级的MATLAB和

151
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,600
Octave users, if you've not heard of this,
don't worry about it.
Octave用户 如果你没有听说过 不用担心

152
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,524
You don't need to know it when you're
coding up neural networks in Python.
你在使用Python写神经网络的过程中并不需要知道它

153
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:38,720
So, that was broadcasting in Python.
这就是Python的broadcasting

154
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,360
I hope that when you do the programming
homework that broadcasting will allow you
希望你做编程作业的时候broadcasting能够

155
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,580
to not only make a code run faster,
使你的代码运行的更快

156
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,920
but also help you get what you want
done with fewer lines of code.
让你用更少的代码完成你想做的

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,630
Before you dive into the programming
excercise, I want to share with you just
在你去做编程作业之前 我想和你分享

158
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,290
one more set of ideas,
which is that there's some tips and
一些技巧 这些技巧

159
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,700
tricks that I've found reduces
the number of bugs in my Python code and
可以减少我的Python代码中的bug

160
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,640
that I hope will help you too.
我希望同样对你有用

161
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,550
So with that,
let's talk about that in the next video.
这些技巧我们在下一个视频中讨论
