00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:04,810
tackle your first programming assignment.
提交你的第一个编程作业

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,914
Before you do that,
在这做之前

5
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:07,070
let me just give you a quick tour
让我快速给你介绍

6
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,396
of ipython notebooks in Coursera.
Coursera需要的ipython notebooks工具

7
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:13,275
Here you see,Jupiter iphython notebooks
这就是Jupiter ipython界面

8
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:14,847
that you can get to in Coursera.
这里你可以连接到Coursera

9
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:17,416
Let me just quickly show you a few features of this.
让我快速告诉你这里面的一些新特性

10
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,222
The instructions are written into this notebook
这些说明写在了notebook

11
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:24,491
and there'll be a few code blocks right here
这里也有空白区域的代码块

12
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,562
that you can write code into.
你可以在这里写代码

13
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:29,351
So occasionally, you see in functions
有时， 有些函数块

14
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,064
blocks that looks like this.
比如像这样

15
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,333
The instructions are right here in the text,
这些说明就在文本中

16
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,032
in the ipython notebook.
在ipython notebook里

17
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,542
And these long, you know,
这些较长

18
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,489
like gray blocks are blocks of code.
灰色的区域代码

19
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,895
So occasionally, you see in these blocks
有时， 你看到这些代码

20
00:00:41,895 --> 00:00:43,363
sometimes they'll say this is
有时会这样

21
00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:45,290
their style code here and end code here.
他的代码格式和结束代码

22
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,805
To do their programing exercise,
去完成编程练习

23
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,506
please make sure to write your code
请确保你的代码

24
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,976
between the start code here and end code here.
写在这开始和结束代码之间

25
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:54,796
So for example, print Hello World.
比如， 打印输出Hello World

26
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:58,117
Right. And, then to execute a code block,
好， 下面执行这块代码

27
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:02,034
you can hit shift enter and then
你可以按shift + enter 执行

28
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,314
they execute this code block,
他会运行这块代码

29
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,290
which I guess we just wrote print Hello World.
他就会输出我们想要的hello world

30
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,210
So that printed Hello World.
所以输出hello world

31
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,923
To run a cell, you can also,
去运行这区域，你也可以

32
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:11,889
to run one of these code blocks in cell,

33
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:14,259
you can also click cell and then run cell.
你也可以点击cell菜单的run cell

34
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,437
So to execute this
执行这部分代码

35
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:20,793
Is possible that on your computer the keyboard shortcut
有可能电脑的快捷键

36
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:23,841
for cell runs cell might be different than shift enter but
去运行cell代码块会不同

37
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:27,943
on both my Mac as well as on my PC,
在Mac或者PC电脑上

38
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:30,271
a shift enter so might be the same for you as well.
不过shift + enter功能应该是一样的

39
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:33,650
Now, when you're reading the instructions if you know,
当你正在阅读指南时候

40
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,298
accidentally double click on it,
不小心双击了它

41
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:38,124
you might end up with this markdown language.
语言框会进行收缩

42
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:40,697
If you end up with this funny looking text,
如果你收缩了这文本框

43
00:01:40,697 --> 00:01:44,501
to convert it back to the nice looking text just run the cell.
去执行收缩了的文本框单元

44
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:48,141
So click on the cell runs cell or I'm going to hit shift enter

45
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,104
and that basically executes the markdown
会执行收缩的文本框

46
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,076
and turns it back into this nice looking code.
他会变回原来易读的代码

47
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:55,477
Just a couple of more tips,

48
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:57,768
when you execute code like this,

49
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:03,175
it actually runs on a kernel

52
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:11,952
you leave a computer for a very long

there is a small chance of the kernel
这里仍有机会

56
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,599
on the back end might die,
让kernel恢复到出错状态

57
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,178
which is just click kernel.
点击kernel

58
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:21,571
And then restart kernel and hopefully
选择restart

59
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:24,667
that will reboot the kernel and make it work again.
他会重新运行kernel使程序继续工作

60
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,486
So that shouldn't happen if you're just running

00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,519
you can try kernel restart.
你可以试着重启kernel

66
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,769
Finally, and I apply to ipython notebook like this
最后，当我使用ipython notebook

67
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,951
there may be multiple blocks of code.
都会有多个代码区域块

68
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:45,062

69
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:47,155
doesn't have any grading code,
没有任何级别或层次的代码

70
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:49,068
be sure to execute this block of code

74
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,396
need in order to execute the lowdown
去执行下面的部分
