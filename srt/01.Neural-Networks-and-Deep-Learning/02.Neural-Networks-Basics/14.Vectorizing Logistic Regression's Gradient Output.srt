1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
In the previous video,
在之前的视频中

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.700
you saw how you can use vectorization to compute their predictions
你知道了如何向量化的计算同时对

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.485
the lowercase a's for an entire training set all at the same time.
整个训练集预测结果a

4
00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:15.030
In this video, you see how you can use vectorization to also
在这个视频中 你将学会如何向量化

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.205
perform the gradient computations for all m training samples.
计算m个训练数据的梯度

6
00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.380
Again, all those at the same time.
强调一下 是同时计算

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.890
And then at the end of this video,
在本视频的末尾

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.175
we'll put it all together and show how you can derive
我们会将之前讲的结合起来 向你展示

9
00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:29.730
a very efficient implementation of logistic regression.
如何得到一个非常高效的logistic回归的实现

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.505
So, you may remember that for the gradient computation,
你可能记得讲梯度计算时

11
00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:36.910
what we did was we computed dz1 for the first example,
我列举了几个例子

12
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.870
which could be a1 minus y1 and then dz2 equals
dz1 = a1-y1

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.134
a2 minus y2 and so on.
d2=a2-y2 等等列举下去

14
00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:56.425
And so on for all m training examples.
对m个训练数据做同样的运算

15
00:00:56.425 --> 00:01:01.218
So, what we're going to do is define a new variable,
我们现在可以定义一个新的变量

16
00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:08.595
dZ is going to be dz1, dz2, dzm.
d(大写)Z = [dz1,dz2,...dzm]

17
00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:13.910
Again, all the d lowercase z variables stacked horizontally.
所有的dz变量横向排列

18
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:21.200
So, this would be 1 by m matrix or alternatively a m dimensional row vector.
dZ将会是一个1*m的矩阵 或者说一个m维行向量

19
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.520
Now recall that from the previous slide,
回忆之前的幻灯片

20
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.405
we'd already figured out how to compute capital A which was this: a1 through
我们已经描述了如何计算A,即[a1,...am]

21
00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:36.735
am and we had defined capital Y as y1 through ym.
我们已经定义了大写字母Y=[y1,...ym]

22
00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:39.200
Also you know, stacked horizontally.
像之前一样 y1,...ym横向排列

23
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.780
So, based on these definitions,
基于这些定义

24
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.770
maybe you can see for yourself that dZ can be computed as
你也许会发现我们可以这样计算dZ

25
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.750
just A minus Y because it's going to be equal to a1 - y1.
dz = A-Y 这等同于

26
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.670
So, the first element, a2 - y2,
[a1-y1,a2-y2...]

27
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.980
so in the second element and so on.
以此类推

28
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.115
And, so this first element a1 - y1 is exactly the definition of dz1.
第一个元素a1-y1就是dz1

29
00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:11.670
The second element is exactly the definition of dz2 and so on.
第二个元素就是dz2 ...

30
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.965
So, with just one line of code,
所以仅需要一行代码

31
00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:20.095
you can compute all of this at the same time.
你就可以同时完成这所有的计算

32
00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:24.010
Now, in the previous implementation,
在之前的实现中

33
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.695
we've gotten rid of one for loop already but we still had
我们已经去掉了一个for循环 但是

34
00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:31.600
this second for loop over training examples.
我们仍然有一个遍历训练集的循环

35
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.440
So we initialize dw to zero to a vector of zeroes.
我们使用dw=0将dw初始化为0向量

36
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.905
But then we still have to loop over training examples where we have
但是我们还有一个遍历训练集的循环

37
00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:43.015
dw plus equals x1 times dz1,
对第一个训练样本有dw+=x1*dz1

38
00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:50.440
for the first training example dw plus equals x2 dz2 and so on.
第二个样本dw+=x2*dz2 ...

39
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.980
So we do the M times and then dw divide equals by m and similarly for B, right?
我们重复M次 然后dw/=m B也类似

40
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.370
db was initialized as 0 and db plus equals dz1.
db被初始化为0向量 然后db+=dz1

41
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.120
db plus equals dz2 down to you know
db+=dz2 这样重复到

42
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.835
dz(m) and db divide equals m. So that's what we had in the previous implementation.
dzm 接着db/=m 这就是我们在之前的实现中做的

43
00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:18.700
We'd already got rid of one for loop.
我们已经去掉了一个for循环

44
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.045
So, at least now dw is a vector and we went separately updating dw1,
至少现在dw是个向量了 然后我们分别

45
00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:26.850
dw2 and so on.
更新dz1 dw2等

46
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.860
So, we got rid of that already but we still
我们去掉了一个for循环但是还

47
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.630
had the for loop over the M examples in the training set.
有个for循环遍历训练集

48
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.290
So, let's take these operations and vectorize them.
让我们继续下面的操作把它们向量化

49
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.380
Here's what we can do, for
我们可以这么做

50
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.745
the vectorize implementation of db was doing is basically summing up,
向量化的实现 db只需要对

51
00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:47.940
all of these dzs and then dividing by m. So,
这些dz求和然后除以m

52
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.580
db is basically one over m,
db=1/m

53
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.530
sum from I equals once through m of dzi and
对dz1到dzm求和

54
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.055
well all the dzs are in that row vector and so in Python,
所有的dz组成了一个行向量 所以

55
00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:04.765
what you do is implement you know,
在Python中你仅需要

56
00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:08.155
1 over m times np.
1/m

57
00:04:08.155 --> 00:04:12.210
sum of the Z.
1/m*np.sum(dZ)

58
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.115
So, you just take this variable and call the np.
你只要把这个变量传给np.sum函数

59
00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:19.195
sum function on it and that would give you db.
就可以得到db

60
00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:22.330
How about dw or just write
那么dw呢

61
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.375
out the correct equations who can verify is the right thing to do.
先写出正确的公式 这才能证明我们做的是正确的

62
00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:28.164
Dw turns out to be one over m,
dw=1/m

63
00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:34.485
times the matrix X times dZ transpose.
dw=1/m*X*dZ转置

64
00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:37.990
And, so kind of see why that's the case.
让我们看看为什么是这样

65
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.806
This equal to one over m then the matrix X's,
这等于1/m乘以

66
00:04:41.806 --> 00:04:48.325
x1 through xm stacked up in columns like that and dZ
列向量x1...xm堆积起来

67
00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:56.040
transpose is going to be dz1 down to dzm like so.
dZ转置是dz1...dzm

68
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.900
And so, if you figure out what this matrix times this vector works out to be,
如果你明白这个矩阵乘以这个向量会得到什么

69
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.585
it is turns out to be one over m times x1
这等于1/m    

70
00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:12.523
dz1 plus... plus xm dzm.
这等于1/m*[x1*dz1+...+xm*dzm]

71
00:05:12.523 --> 00:05:21.405
And so, this is a n*1 vector and this is what you actually end up with,
这是一个n*1的向量 也就是你最终得到的

72
00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:24.725
with dw because dw was taking these you know,
因为dw中包括了这些

73
00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:27.710
xi dzi and adding them up and so that's what exactly
xi*dzi 然后把他们加起来

74
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.300
this matrix vector multiplication is doing and so again,
就是这个矩阵和向量相乘做的

75
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.655
with one line of code you can compute dw.
只要一行代码你就可以计算出dw

76
00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:40.010
So, the vectorized implementation of the derivative calculations is just this,
向量化计算导数的实现就像下面这样

77
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.540
you use this line to implement db and use
你用这行代码计算db

78
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.540
this line to implement dw and notice that without the for loop over the training set,
这行代码计算dw 注意我们没有在训练集上使用for循环

79
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.265
you can now compute the updates you want to your parameters.
现在你可以计算参数的更新

80
00:05:55.265 --> 00:06:01.185
So now, let's put all together into how you would actually implement logistic regression.
现在 我们回顾之前所学 看看应该如何实现一个logistic回归

81
00:06:01.185 --> 00:06:02.550
So, this is our original,
这是我们之前的

82
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.866
highly inefficient non vectorize implementation.
没有向量化非常低效

83
00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:11.775
So, the first thing we've done in the previous video was get rid of this volume, right?
首先是我们在前一个视频中做的去掉这一堆

84
00:06:11.775 --> 00:06:14.400
So, instead of looping over dw1,
不用循环遍历

85
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.755
dw2 and so on,
dw1 dw2等

86
00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:23.595
we have replaced this with a vector value dw which is dw+= xi,
我们已经用一个向量化的代码dw+=xi替换这些 

87
00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:28.775
which is now a vector times dz(i).
xi是一个向量 给他乘以dzi

88
00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:32.000
But now, we will see that we can also get rid of not
现在 我们不仅要取消那些循环

89
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.670
just for loop of those but also get rid of this for loop.
还要取消掉这个for循环

90
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.654
So, here is how you do it.
你可以这么做

91
00:06:38.654 --> 00:06:42.925
So, using what we have from the previous slides,
用前面幻灯片我们得到的

92
00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:47.085
you would say, capitalZ, Z equal to w transpose X + b
Z=wTX + B

93
00:06:47.085 --> 00:06:57.625
and the code you is write capital Z equals np.
你的代码应该是Z=np.dot(w.T,X)+b

94
00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:07.315
w transpose X + b and then A equals sigmoid of capital Z.
然后A = sigmoid(Z)

95
00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:12.710
So, you have now computed all of this and all of this for all the values of I.
你已经对所有i完成了这些和这些计算

96
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.715
Next on the previous slide,
之前的幻灯片

97
00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:21.070
we said you would compute dZ equals A - Y.
我们知道你还应该计算dZ=A-Y

98
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.460
So, now you computed all of this for all the values of i.
就对所有i完成了这个计算

99
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:32.495
Then, finally dw equals 1/m x
最后 dw=1/m XdZ.T

100
00:07:32.495 --> 00:07:39.700
dZ transpose and db equals 1/m of you know, np.
db=1/m np.sum(dZ)

101
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.328
sum dZ.
db=1/m np.sum(dZ)

102
00:07:43.328 --> 00:07:49.120
So, you've just done front propagation and back propagation,
你完成了前向和后向传播

103
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.030
really computing the predictions and computing the derivatives on
确实实现了对所有训练样本进行预测和求导

104
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.340
all M training examples without using a for loop.
而且没有使用一个for循环

105
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.835
And so the gradient descent update then would be you know w
然后梯度下降更新参数

106
00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:04.462
gets updated as w minus the learning rate times
w=w-α*dw

107
00:08:04.462 --> 00:08:12.020
dw which was just computed above and B is update as B minus the learning rate times db.
b=b-α*db

108
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.341
Sometimes it's pretty close to notice that it is an assignment,
有时候这和赋值很接近

109
00:08:17.341 --> 00:08:21.675
but I guess I haven't been totally consistent with that notation.
不过我应该没有完全使用这个符号

110
00:08:21.675 --> 00:08:25.450
But with this, you have just implemented
有了这些 

111
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.635
a single iteration of gradient descent for logistic regression.
我们就通过一次迭代实现一次梯度下降

112
00:08:29.635 --> 00:08:32.308
Now, I know I said that we should get rid of
我们能不使用for循环时

113
00:08:32.308 --> 00:08:35.260
explicit for loops whenever you can but if you want to
就不要使用for循环 但是如果你希望

114
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.230
implement multiple iteration as
多次迭代进行

115
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.880
a gradient descent then you still need a for loop over the number of iterations.
梯度下降 那么你仍然需要for循环

116
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.860
So, if you want to have a thousand deliveration of gradient descent,
如果你要求1000次导数进行梯度下降

117
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:53.675
you might still need a for loop over the iteration number.
你或许仍旧需要一个for循环

118
00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:55.870
There is an outermost for loop like that then I
这个最外面的for循环

119
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.210
don't think there is any way to get rid of that for loop.
我认为应该没有方式把他去掉

120
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.390
But I do think it's incredibly cool that you can implement
不过我还是觉得一次迭代就可以进行一次梯度下降

121
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.117
at least one iteration of gradient descent without needing to use a full loop.
而不需要任何循环 这很cool

122
00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:09.880
So, that's it you now have a highly vectorize and
你得到了一个高度向量化的

123
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.745
highly efficient implementation of gradient descent for logistic regression.
非常高效的logistic回归的梯度下降算法

124
00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:18.850
There is just one more detail that I want to talk about in the next video,
这里有一些细节我想在下个视频中讨论

125
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:24.155
which is in our description here I briefly alluded to this technique called broadcasting.
这里我简单提一下 这种技术被称为broadcasting

126
00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:28.240
Broadcasting turns out to be a technique that Python and
Broadcasting也是一种能够使你的

127
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.915
numpy allows you to use to make certain parts of your code also much more efficient.
Python和Numpy部分代码更高效的技术

128
00:09:32.915 --> 00:09:37.090
So, let's see some more details of broadcasting in the next video.
我们在下个视频中学习关于broadcasting的更多细节
