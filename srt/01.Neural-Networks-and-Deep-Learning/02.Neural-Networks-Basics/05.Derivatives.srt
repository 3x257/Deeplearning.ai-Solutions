33
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:11,218
up the box and peer a little bit further

40
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,441
expert in calculus if you're very
精通微积分的一员，你对

41
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,551
familiar with calculus observe this it's
微积分非常熟悉

42
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:30,291
probably okay for you to skip this video
你可以跳过这部分视频

43
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,803
but for everyone else let's dive in and
其他同学，让我们开始

44
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:35,111
try to get an intuitive understanding of
深入学习

45
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,087
derivatives I've plotted here the
导数。我在这里画了一个

46
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:40,478
function f of a equals 3a so it's just
函数，f(a)=3a,它是

47
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:42,820
a straight line to gain intuition about
一条直线，来简单理解

48
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,603
derivatives let's look at a few points
导数。让我们看看

49
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:47,467
on this function let's say that a is
函数中几个点，假定a

50
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,645
equal to 2 in that case f of a which is
等于2,那么f(a)

51
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:54,012
equal to 3 times a is equal to 6 so if a
等于a的3倍,等于6，也就是说如果a

52
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:57,402
is equal to 2 then you know F of a will
等于2,那么函数f(a)

53
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:59,438
be equal to 6 let's say we give the
等于6.假定我们

54
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,291
value of a you know just a little bit of
稍微改变a的值，只变一点点

55
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,765
a nudge I'm going to just bump up me a
移动，只增加

56
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:07,374
little bit so there is now 2.00 1 right
一点点，2.001

57
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:09,065
so I'm going to get a like a tiny little
我将微小的

58
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:13,078
nudge to the right so now is let's say 2.001
右移，这时是2.001

59
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:16,621
this plug this is to scale 2.001
这个坐标值是2.001

60
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,414
the 0.001 difference is too small to
0.001的差别实在太小了

61
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:21,894
show on this plot this give them a
不能在图中显示，我们

62
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:24,455
little nudge to the right now f of a is
把它右移一点，现在f(a)

63
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:26,987
equal to three times a so six point
等于a的3倍是

64
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:29,813
zero zero three,Simplot this over here
6.003,画在这里

65
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:32,459
this is not to the scale this is six point
比例不太符合，这是

66
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,901
zero zero three so if you look at this
6.003，你看

67
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,698
low triangle here some highlighting in
这个小三角形，绿色高亮部分

68
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:40,275
green what we see is that if I match a
如果我

69
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:44,696
0.001 to the right then F of a goes up
向右移动0.001，那么f(a)增加

70
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:49,667
by 0.003 the amount that F of a went up
0.003，f的值增加

71
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,831
is three times as big as the amount that
3倍于

72
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,175
I judged nudging a to the right so we're going
右移的a,因此我们

73
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,880
to say that the slope of the derivative
说：斜率，这个导数

74
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,339
of the function f of a at a equals two
函数f(a)在a等于2

75
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,967
or when a is equal to 2 the slope is
或者说，当a=2时，斜率是

76
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,406
three and you know the term derivative
3，导数这个概念

77
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:09,878
basically means slope is just that
基本意味着斜率

78
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:12,286
derivative sound like a scary a more
导数听起来是一个很可怕

79
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:14,350
intimidating word whereas slope is a
很令人惊恐的词，但是斜率以一种

80
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,636
friendlier way to describe the concept
很友好的方式来描述导数这个

81
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:17,639
of derivative so one of these year
概念，所以有时提到

82
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,015
derivative just think slope of the
导数，把它当做函数的斜率

83
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:22,679
function and more formally the slope is
就好了，更正式的斜率

84
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:26,595
defined as the height divided by the
定义为高除以

85
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:28,848
width of this little triangle that we
宽，在这个绿色小三角形

86
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:32,065
have in green so this is you know 0.003
即0.003

87
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:35,818
over 0.001 and the fact that the slope is
除以0.001，斜率

88
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:37,665
equal to 3 or the derivative is equal 3
等于3，或者说导数等于3

89
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:40,182
just represents the fact that when you
这表示当你

90
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:43,154
nudge a to the right by 0.001 by tiny
将a右移0.001，移动一点点

91
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:46,533
amount the amount that F of a goes up is
f(a)的数额增加

92
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:49,343
three times as big as the amount that
3倍的量

93
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:51,991
united the united a in the horizontal
水平方向a的总量

94
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:53,744
direction so that's all that the slope
这就是这条线的斜率

95
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:55,653
of a line is now let's look at this
现在让我们看看

96
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,863
function at a different point let's say
这个函数，从不同的角度

97
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,891
that a is now equal to five
假设a等于5

98
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,802
in that case f of a three times a is
此时f(a),3乘以a

99
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:05,497
equal to 15 so let's say I again give a
等于15，我再一次

100
00:04:05,497 --> 00:04:06,431
and notch to the right
右移a

101
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,481
a tiny level less is now bumped up to
很小幅度，增加到

102
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,742
five point oo one F of a is three
5.001,f(a)等于

103
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:11,284
times that
3倍

104
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,111
so f of a is equal to fifteen point zero
f(a)等于15.003

105
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:18,371
three and so once again when I bump up a to
再一次当我增加a

106
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,188
the right nudge a to the right by 0.001
将a右移0.001

107
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:23,306
F of a goes up three times as much
f(a)增加3倍

108
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:27,481
so the slope again at a equals five is
所以在a等于5时，斜率

109
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:30,544
also three so the way we write is that
是3，所以我们将

110
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:32,869
the slope of the function f is equal to
函数f等于3的斜率表达为

111
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:38,746
three we say D F of a da and this just
d f(a)/da

112
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,264
means the slope of the function f of a
这表示f(a)的斜率

113
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:43,921
when you nudge the variable a a tiny
当你微小改变变量a

114
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:47,352
little amount um this is equal to three
的值，它等于3

115
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:50,287
and an alternative way to write this
一个替代方式表达

116
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:52,749
derivative formula is as follows you can
导数公式是你可以

117
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:58,675
also write this as d da of f of a so
这样写，d/da f(a)

118
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,616
whether you put the f of a on top of
不管你是否将f(a)放在上面

119
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:02,356
whether you write it you know down here
或是放在这里（右边）

120
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:03,145
it doesn't matter
都没有关系

121
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,743
but all those equation means is that if
这些等式表示如果

122
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:08,165
I nudge a to the right a little bit
将a右移一点

123
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:11,420
I expect F of a to go up by three times
那么f(a)增加3倍

124
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,806
as much as I nudge just the value of
我移动a的值

125
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:17,684
little a now for this video I explained
在这个视频中我讲解

126
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,336
derivatives talking about what happens
导数，谈论的情况是

127
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:26,164
we nudge the variable a by 0.001 um if
我们将变量a偏移0.001，如果

128
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:27,746
you want the formal mathematical
你想知道正式的

129
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:28,981
definition of the derivatives
导数数学定义

130
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:31,438
derivatives are defined with an even
导数是

131
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:34,131
smaller value of how much you nudge a to
你右移a非常小的值

132
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:36,731
the right so it's not often 00 1 is not
不是0.001

133
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:43,189
0.00000001 is not 0.0ooooo and so on 1 is sort of
不是0.00000001，不是0.00000..1,是

134
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,236
even smaller than that and the formal
非常非常小的值,通常

135
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:47,673
definition of derivative says what have
导数的定义是

136
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:50,149
you nudge a to the right by an info
你右移a以

137
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,132
testable amount basically an infinite
可度量的值

138
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,599
infinitely tiny tiny amount if you do
一个无限小的值

139
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,618
that just f of a go up three times as
f(a)增加3倍

140
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,881
much as whatever was a tiny tiny tiny
增加了一个非常非常小的值

141
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,653
amount that you now stay to the right so
也就是在这个三角形右边的变化值

142
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,152
that's actually the formal definition of
那就是导数的正式定义

143
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:06,225
a derivative but for the purposes of our
但是为了

144
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,040
intuitive understanding we're going to
直观的认识，我们将

145
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,154
talk about nudging a to the right by
探讨右移a以

146
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:13,616
this small amount 0.001 even if it's
0.001这个值即使

147
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:17,489
0.001 isn't exactly you know tiny tiny
0.001并不是无穷小的

148
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:20,183
insa testable now one property of the
可测数据.导数的一个特性是

149
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:22,966
derivative is that no matter where you
这个函数任何

150
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,046
take the slope of this function it is
地方的斜率总是

151
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,988
equal to 3 whether a is equal to 2 or a

value of f of a goes up by three times
f(a)的值就增加3倍

157
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:41,958
as much so this function has the same
