00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,033
in this video and show you a slightly
在这个视频中 我将给出一个


2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:04,164
more complex example where the slope of
更加复杂的例子 在这个例子中

3
00:00:04,164 --> 00:00:07,312
the function can be different at different points in the function
函数在不同点处的斜率是不一样的

4
00:00:07,312 --> 00:00:09,194
let's start with an example here I plot to the
先来举个例子 我在这里画一个函数

5
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:12,739
function f of a equals a squared let's
f(a)等于a的平方

6
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:15,427
take a look at the point in equals two
来看看a等于2的点

7
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:19,382
so a squared or F of a is equal to four
在这个点上 a的平方等于4

8
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:22,949
let's nudge a slightly to the right so
让我们稍稍往右推进一点点

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,775
now a is equal to two point zero zero
现在a等于2.001

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,990
one f of a which is a squared is going
而f(a) 即a的平方

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,228
to be approximately four point zero zero
大约为4.004

12
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:33,675
four it turns out that the exact value
但是 如果你用计算器算的话

13
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,751
if you call the calculator and figure this out is actually four point zero
这个准确的值应该为

14
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:40,116
zero four zero zero one now I'm just to
4.004001 我只是为了简便起见

15
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:43,030
say a 4.04 is close enough so what this
省略了后面的部分

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,240
means is that when a is equal to two
所以这里想表达的是 当a等于2时

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,999
let's plot that here so if this is a is
我们把它画在这里

18
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:51,098
equal to 2 F of a is equal to four but
如果a等于2的话 那么f(a)就等于4

19
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:52,974
when I nudge a little bit to the right
但是当我稍稍往右移动一点的时候

20
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:56,801
two point zero zero one then it goes up to the x
即a=2.001的时候 注意这里

21
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,428
and y-axes are not to scale here then it
图上的x轴和y轴是不成比例的

22
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:02,440
goes up to about four point zero zero
然后这里的y大约为4.004

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,236
four again the x and y-axes here are not
再次注意这里的x轴和y轴是不成比例的

24
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:07,481
drawn to scale let's draw this on the
我们重新在图上画一下

25
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:10,185
plot so what we're saying is that if a
如果a等于2的话

26
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:13,488
is equal to 2 then F of a is equal to 4
那么f(a)就等于4

27
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:16,552
and here at the x and y axes are not
注意这里x轴和y轴的比例还是不太准确

28
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:19,045
drawn to scale technically this vertical
实际上这个点的高度

29
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,777
height should be much higher than this
要比这里纵轴的x值

30
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:22,522
horizontal height so the x and y axes
还要大那么一点点 所以x轴和y轴

31
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:25,350
are not on the same scale um but if I
还是不成比例的

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,397
now nudge a to 2.001 then F of a
如果让a等于2.001

33
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:33,262
becomes roughly 4.004 so if you draw this
则f(a)约为4.004 如果你在这儿画

34
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:36,072
little triangle again what this means is
一个小三角形 你就会发现

35
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:40,134
that if I nudge a to the right by 0.001 f
如果把a往右移动0.001

36
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:44,443
of a goes up four times as much by 0.004
那么f(a)将增大四倍 即增大0.004

37
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:46,855
so in the language of calculus we say
在微积分中 我们把这个

38
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:49,277
that the slope that is the derivative
此三角形斜边的斜率

39
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:56,021
from F of a at a equals 2 is 4 or to
称为f(a)在点a=2处的导数(即为4)

40
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:58,049
write this out with calculus notation
或者写成微积分的形式

41
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,016
we say that d/da of f of a is equal to 4
当a等于2的时候

42
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:05,514
when a is equal to 2 now one thing about
d/da f(a)等于4 由此可知

43
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:07,669
this function f of a equals a square is
函数f(a)=a^2

44
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,606
that the slope is different for
在a取不同值的时候

45
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,419
different values of a this is different
它的斜率是不同的 这和

46
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,056
and the example we saw on the previous slide
上个视频中的例子是不同的

47
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:17,381
so let's look at a different point if a
现在换个点来看看

48
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:20,254
is equal to 5 so except equals 2 now you
如果a等于5(不再等于2)

49
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:23,967
have a equals 5 then a squared is equal to 25
a等于5 那么a的平方则为25

50
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:27,643
so that's f of a if I nudge a to the
所以这是f(a)的值 如果再一次

51
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:28,332
right again
把a往右移一点点

52
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:31,299
it's tiny little nudge of a so now a is 5
只是移动非常小的一段距离

53
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,338
point 0 0 1 then F of a will be
现在a等于5.001 而f(a)的值

54
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:40,441
approximately 25 point 0 1 0 so what we
大约为25.010 由此可见

55
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:44,387
see is that by nudging a up by 0.001 F
当我们只往右移动了0.001时

56
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:47,529
of a goes up 10 times as much so we have
f(a)却增大了10倍

57
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:51,477
that d da f of a is equal to 10 when a
即可以写作d/da f(a)等于10

58
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:54,421
is equal to 5 because F of a goes up 10
而此时a的值为5 这里只是小小地

59
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,654
times as much as a does when I make a
移动了a 就使得f(a)的值

60
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:59,379
tiny little nudge to a so one way to see
增大了10倍 这里有种直观的方法可以解释

61
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,005
why the derivative is different at
为什么一个点的斜率

62
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,751
different points is that if you draw
在不同位置会不同 如果你在曲线上

63
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:07,444
that here a little triangle right at different locations on this you see that
的不同位置画一些小小的三角形 你就会发现

64
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:09,598
the ratio of the height of the triangle
三角形高和宽的比值

65
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,255
over the width of the triangle is very
在曲线上不同的地方

66
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,205
different at different points on the
它们是不同的

67
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:17,322
curve so here the slope is equal to 4
所以当a=2时，这里

68
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,635
when a is equal to 2 but is equal to 10
的斜率为4 而当a=5时

69
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:22,530
when a is equal to 5 now if you pull up
这里的斜率为10 如果你翻看

70
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,217
a calculus textbook a calculus textbook will tell you that
微积分的课本 课本会告诉你

71
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:29,278
d/da of f of a so f of a is equal to a
d/da f(a) 这里f(a)等于a的平方

72
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:32,225
square so that d/da of a squared one of the
所以d/da f(a)的值

73
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,306
formulas you find that the calculus
由课本上的公式可知

74
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:35,244
textbook is that this thing the slope of
这个函数f(a)=a^2的斜率

75
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:37,893
the function a squared is equal to 2a
应该等于2a

76
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,252
I'm not going to prove this but the way you
我不会在这里证明这个公式

77
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,338
find yours out is that you open up a
但是你可以打开你的微积分课本

78
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:44,821
calculus textbooks to the table formulas
找到上面的公式表

79
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,464
and it'll tell you the derivative of two
它会告诉你f(a)=a^2

80
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:50,003
of a squared is equal to 2a and indeed
的导数确实为2a

81
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:52,026
this is consistent with what we've
事实上这也和我们

82
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:54,809
worked out mainly when a is equal to 2
手工算的结果一样 当a为2时

83
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:58,913
the slopes of function to a is 2 times 2
函数的斜率为2乘以2

84
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:01,825
is therefore equal to 4 and when a is
即等于4 当a为5时

85
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,897
equal to 5 then the slope of the
函数的斜率为

86
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:06,805
function 2 times a is 2 times 5 is equal
2乘以a 即2乘以5等于10

87
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:09,791
to 10 so if you ever pull up a calculus
如果你翻看微积分课本

88
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,305
textbook and you see this formula that
你会看到这个公式

89
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:14,725
the derivative of a squared is equal to
即a的平方的导数等于2a

90
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:17,740
2a all that means is that for any given
这意味着任意给定一点a

91
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,265
value of a if you nudge it up with by
如果你稍微将a

92
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:26,295
0.001 already your tiny little value you
增大0.001

93
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:31,086
would expect f of a to go up by 2a that
那么你会看到f(a)将增大2a

94
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:33,581
is the slope or the derivative times
即增大的值为点在a处斜率或导数

95
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,289
however much you had an urge to the
乘以你向右移动的距离

96
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,101
right the value of a now one tiny little
现在 有个小细节需要注意

97
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:40,813
detail you know I have used these
之前我在这里

98
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,216
approximate symbols here and this wasn't
使用了一些不精确的值 这里的值

99
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,435
exactly 4.04 there's an extra point 001
不应该为4.04 你知道这里

100
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:49,235
you know there it turns out that this
应该还有额外001 这里有

101
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:52,653
extra pont 001 this little thing here is
额外的001 是因为

102
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:55,008
because we were nudging a to the right
我们把a向右移动了0.001

103
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:57,915
by 0.001 if we're instead nudging it to
然而 如果我们把a

104
00:04:57,915 --> 00:05:00,553
the right by this new infinitesimally
向右移动像这样一个非常非常小的值

105
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:03,312
small value then this extra ever term
那么这个额外的项

106
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:06,341
will go away and you find that the
将可以被忽略 这样的话

107
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,792
amount that f of a goes up is exactly
你会发现f(a)增大的值

108
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:12,581
equal to the derivative times the amount
刚好等于导数乘以

109
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,696
that you nudged to the right and
你向右边移动的距离

110
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:17,783
the reason why is not 4.004 exactly is
至于为什么不是刚好等于4.004

111
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:20,301
because derivatives are defined using
是因为导数就是根据

112
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:23,747
this infinitesimally small not just to
这个极小值来定义的

113
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:26,393
a rather than you know 0.001 which is
而这里的0.001虽然比较小

114
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,363
well and while 0.001 is small is not
但是它还不足以小到

115
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,901
infinitesimally small so that's why the
可以被忽略 这就是为什么

116
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,685
amount that effort where it went up
例子中导数增大的值

117
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:35,995
isn't exactly given by the formula but
不是刚好等于导数公式算出来的值

118
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,261
is only kind of approximately given by
而只是根据导数算出来的一个估计值

119
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:40,204
the derivative to wrap up this video
为了总结这堂课所学的知识

120
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:42,279
let's just go through a few more quick
我们再来看看几个例子

121
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,707
examples the example you've already seen
之前你已经知道的是

122
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:49,205
is that if f of a equals a squared then
f(a)等于a的平方

123
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:52,859
in calculus textbooks formula table will
按照微积分课本上的写法

124
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,665
tell you that the derivative is equal to
这个函数的导数应该为2a

125
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:57,430
2a and so the example we went through
和之前的例子一样

126
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,072
was that if a is equal to 2 f of a
如果a等于2 那么f(a)等于4

127
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:03,927
equals 4 and if we nudge a so it's a
如果我们把a向右边移动一点

128
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,692
little bit bigger then f of a is about
那么f(a)将增大一点 大约为4.004

129
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:10,295
4.004 and so f of a went up four times as
所以f(a)增大了向右移动距离的四倍

130
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:13,307
much and indeed when a is equal to 2 the
所以事实上 当a等于2时

131
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,457
derivative is equal to 4 let's look at
导数的值为4

132
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:18,083
some other examples let's say instead
来看看其他例子

133
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,135
f of a is equal to a cubed if you go to a
假设f(a)等于a的三次方 如果你

134
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:23,466
calculus textbook and look up the table
翻看微积分课本上的导数公式表

135
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,102
of formulas you see that the slope of the
你会发现这个函数的斜率

136
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:28,441
function again the derivative of this
即这个函数的导数

137
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:31,963
function is equal to 3a squared so you
等于3乘以a的平方

138
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:35,064
can get this formula out of a calculus textbook
你可以从微积分课本上查到这个公式

139
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:38,602
so what this means so the way to
所以这是什么意思呢

140
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:41,087
interpret this is as follows let's take
同样地举一个例子

141
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:42,875
a equals 2 as an example again
我们再次令a等于2

142
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:47,665
so f of a or a cubed is equal to 8 does
所以a的三次方等于8

143
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:50,836
2 to power 3 so if we give a tiny little
即2的三次方 如果我们又将a增大一点点

144
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:54,769
nudge you find that f of a is about
你会发现f(a)的值

145
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:57,980
eight point zero one two and feel free
大约为8.012 你可以自己检查一遍

146
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
to check this take two point zero zero
如果我们取8.012

147
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,150
one two three you find that is very
你会发现2.001的三次方

148
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,713
close to eight point zero one two and
和8.012很接近

149
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:06,939
indeed when a is equal to 2 that's 3
事实上 当a等于2时

150
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:10,482
times 2 squared that's equal to 3 times
导数值为3乘以2的平方

151
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:12,905
4 is equal to 12 so the derivative
即3乘以4等于12 所以导数公式

152
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:14,889
formula predicts that if you now nudge a
表明如果你将a向右移动

153
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,127
to the right by a tiny little bit f of a
很小的一段距离

154
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:20,423
should go up 12 times as much and indeed
那么f(a)将会增大向右移动距离的12倍

155
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:23,199
this is true when a went up by point 001
所以当a增加0.001时

156
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,415
f of a went up 12 times as much by point 012
f(a)增大了四倍 即0.012

157
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,388
just one last example and then we'll
来看最后一个例子

158
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:32,050
wrap up let's say the f of a is equal to
假设f(a)是一个log函数

159
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,439
the log function right so I'm going to
即f(a)=log(a)

160
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,988
write log of a and I'm going to use a
写作log(a) 然后我将使用

161
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:39,707
umm base e logarithm so some people
一个以e为底数的对数函数 有些人

162
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:42,519
write that as ln of a so if you go to
可能会写作ln(a)

163
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,617
calculus textbooks you find that when
所以如果你去看微积分课本

164
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:47,612
you take the derivative of log of a and
那么log(a)的导数

165
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:50,685
so this is a function that just looks
注意函数log(a)的图像是这样的

166
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:53,199
like that the slope of this function is
函数log(a)的斜率

167
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,539
given by 1 over a so the way to
应该为a分之1 所以我们

168
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:00,241
interpret this is that if a is any value
可以解释如下 如果a取任何值

169
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:02,877
again let's just keep using equals 2 as
比如又取a等于2

170
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:05,752
an example um and you nudge a to the
然后又把a

171
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:09,844
right by 0.001 you would expect f of a
向右边移动0.001 那么f(a)将增大a分之1

172
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:14,269
to go up by 1 over a that is by the
即函数f(a)的导数

173
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,542
derivative times the amounts that you
乘以你增大a的值(0.001)

174
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:20,610
increase a so in fact um if you pull up a
事实上 如果你借助计算器的话

175
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,102
calculator you find that as a is equal
你会发现当a等于2时

176
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:31,755
to 2 f of a is about 0.69315 and if you
f(a)约为0.69315

177
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:35,472
increase f and if you increase a to 2
如果你增加f 如果你将a增大到2.001

178
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:42,202
point 001 then f of a is about 0.69365
那么f(a)约为0.69365

179
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:47,941
so it's gone up by 0.0005
所以f(a)增大了0.0005

180
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,407
indeed if you look at the formula for the
事实上 如果你查看导数公式

181
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:55,198
derivative when a is equal to 2 d/da f of
当a等于2的时候

182
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:58,482
a is equal to 1/2 so this derivative
导数值d/da f(a)等于二分之一

183
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:01,135
formula predicts that if you pump up a
所以导数公式表明 如果你

184
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:04,898
by 0.001 you will expect f of a to go up
把a增大0.001

185
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:07,034
by only one half as much and one half
f(a)将只会增大0.001的二分之一

186
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:12,133
0.0001 is 0.0005 which is exactly what we
即0.0005 这就是我们所得到的值

187
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:15,309
got right then when a goes up by 0.001
当a增大0.001时

188
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:18,200
going from a close to two equals two
从a等于2增大到非常近的2.001

189
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,017
point 001 f of a goes up by half as
f(a)增大了

190
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,271
much as this are going up by
这个(0.001)的二分之一

191
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,073
approximately 0.0005 so if you draw that
即增大了大约0.0005 所以如果你在这儿

192
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:29,422
little triangle if you will is that if
画个小三角形 你就会发现

193
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:32,835
on the horizontal axis goes up by 0.001
如果x轴增加了0.001

194
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:35,954
under vertical axis log of a goes up by
那么y轴上的函数log(a)

195
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:41,609
half of that so point 0005 and so that one
将增大0.001的一半 即0.0005

196
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:44,597
over a 1/2 in this case when a is equal
所以a分之1 当a等于2时这里是二分之一

197
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:46,772
to 2 that's just the slope of this line
这个二分之一就是当a等于2时

198
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:50,417
when a is equal to 2 so that's it for
这条线的斜率 这些就是有关

199
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,330
derivatives there's just two take-home
导数的一些知识 所以在这个视频中

200
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,864
messages from this video first is that
你只需要记住两点 第一点是

201
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,919
the derivative of the function just
函数的导数

202
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,339
means the slope of a function and the
就是函数的斜率

203
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,385
slope of a function can be different at
而函数的斜率

204
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:03,426
different points on the function in our
在不同的点是不同的

205
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:05,696
first example where f of a equals 3a
在第一个例子中f(a)=3a

206
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:07,974
this is a straight line the derivative was
这是一条直线 在任何点

207
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,749
the same everywhere it was 3 everywhere
它的斜率都是相同的 均为3

208
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:11,733
but for other functions like f of a
但是对于函数f(a)=a^2

209
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,925
equals a squared or f(a) equals log of a
或者f(a)=log(a)

210
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:17,096
the slope of the line varys so the
它们的斜率是变化的

211
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:18,843
slope or the derivative can be different
所以它们的导数或者斜率

212
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:21,072
at different points on the curve so does
在曲线上不同的点处是不同的

213
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:22,768
the first take away derivative just
所以这是第一个你需要记住的

214
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:25,484
means slope of a line second takeaway is
即导数就是斜率 第二点是

215
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:26,899
that if you want to look up the
如果你想知道

216
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,638
derivative of a function you can flip

你可参考你的微积分课本或者维基百科

218
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:33,903
Wikipedia and often get a formula for
然后你应该就能

219

the slope of these functions at
找到这些函数的导数公式

220
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:37,900
different points so that I hope you have
