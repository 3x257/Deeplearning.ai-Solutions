1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.949
in the last video we work through an

2
00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.380
example of using a computation graph to

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.750
compute a function J now let's take a

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.580
cleaned up version at their computation

5
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.740
graph and show how you can use it to

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.740
figure out derivative calculations for

7
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.320
that function J so here's a computation

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.289
graph let's say you want to compute the

9
00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.519
derivative of J with respect to B so

10
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.920
what is that well this says if we were

11
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.230
to take this value of B and change it a

12
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.019
little bit how would the value of J

13
00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.809
change well J is defined as um V times D

14
00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.170
and right now B is equal to 11 so then

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.230
with the bump up B by a little bit to 11

16
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.250
point oo 1 then J which is currently 33

17
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
will end up being bumps up to V times a

18
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.690
new value of V becomes 33 0.001 and so

19
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.329
if you bump up V by 0.001 um then J

20
00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.110
which is 3 D so currently 33 will get

21
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.970
bumped up to 33 point zero 3 so here

22
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.580
we've increased V by 0.001 and the net

23
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.189
result of that is that J goes up three

24
00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.740
times as much so the derivative of J of

25
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.590
respect to B is equal to three because

26
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.250
the increase in J is three times the

27
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.100
increase in V and in fact this is very

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.070
analogous to the example we had in the

29
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.500
previous video where we had on F of a

30
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.619
equals three a and so we then derive

31
00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.009
that DF da which was slightly simplified

32
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.869
letting sloppy notation you can read it

33
00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.970
d FD a was equal to three

34
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.790
right so instead here we have um J

35
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.560
equals BB and so DJ D V is equal to

36
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.930
three with here J playing the role of F

37
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.959
and V playing the role of a in this

38
00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.090
previous example that we had right from

39
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.410
from an earlier video so indeed

40
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.330
terminology of backpropagation what

41
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.709
we're seeing is that if you want to

42
00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.890 
compute the derivative of this final

43
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.900
output variable which usually is a

44
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.810
variable you care most about with

45
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.720
respect to B then we've done you know

46
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.599
sort of one step of back propagation so

47
00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.670
we've gone one step backwards in this

48
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.700
graph now let's look at another example

49
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.950
what is DJ da in other words if we bump

50
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.560
up the value of a how does that affect

51
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.060
the value of J well let's go through the

52
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.700
example right now a is equal to five so

53
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.090
let's bump it up to five point zero one

54
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.360
the net impact of that is at D which was

55
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.140
a plus u so that was previous 11 this we

56
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.510
can increase the eleven point zero one

57
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.060
and then we've already seen as above

58
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.340
that J now gets bump up to thirty three

59
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.010
point zero zero three so what we've seen

60
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.100
is that if you increase a by 0.001 J

61
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.340
increases by point zero three and by

62
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.200
increase a I mean maybe you were to take

63
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.329
this value five and just plug in a new

64
00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.120
value right then the change to a will

65
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.500 
propagate to the rights of the

66
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.200
computation graph so the J ends up being

67
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.850
thirty three point zero three and so the

68
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.340
increase the J is three times the

69
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.470
increase to a so that means this

70
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.190
derivative is equal to three and one way

71
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.799
to break this down is to say that if you

72
00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.980
have if you change a then that will

73
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.549
change V and through changing B that

74
00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.010
will change a and so the net change to

75
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.109
the value of J when you bump up the

76
00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.060
value and when you nudge the value of a

77
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:14.340
up a little bit is that um first by

78
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.450
changing a you end up increasing B well

79
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.789
how much does D increase right it is

80
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.440
increased by an amount determined by DV da

82
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.030
and then the change in V will cause the

83
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.980
value of J to also increase so in

84
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.930
calculus is actually called the chain

85
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.650
rule that is a affects V of X J then the

86
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.590
amount that J changes where you nudge a

87
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.480
is the product of how much V changes

88
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.480
when you nudge a times how much J

89
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.570
changes when you nudge B so in calculus

90
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.370
um the gate is called the chain rule and

91
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.410
what we saw from this calculation is

92
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.260
that if you increase a by point zero one

93
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.630
V changes by the same amount so DV da is

94
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.330
equal to one so in fact if you plug in

95
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.470
what we have worked our previously Oh

96
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:25.290
DVD J is equal to three and DVD a is

97
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.600
equal to one so the product of these

98
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.669
three times one then I should give you

99
00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.490
the correct value that DJ da is equal to

100
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.610
3 so this illustration shows how by

101
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.169
having computed DJ DV of this derivative

102
00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.720
respect to this variable it can then

103
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.200
help you to compute DJ da and so that's

104
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.240
another step within some backward

105
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.190
calculation I'll just introduce one more

106
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.570
new notational convention which is that

107
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.970
in when you're writing code to implement

108
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.850
back-propagation they'll usually be some

109
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.340
final output variable that you really

110
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.710
care about right so the final output

111
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.580
variable that you really care about

112
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.080
whether you want to optimize and in this

113
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.690
case this final output variable is Jane

114
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.280
is really the last node in your

115
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.010
computation graph and so a lot of the

116
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.260
computations will be trying to compute

117
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.360 
the derivative of that you know final

118
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.250
output variable so D of this final

119
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.650
output variable with respect to some

120
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.580
other variable and just call that D fall right

122
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.580
so a lot of the computations you have

123
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.710
would be to compute the derivative of

124
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.930
the final output variable really J in

125
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.000
this case with various intermediate

126
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.720
variables such as ABC U or V and when

127
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.500
you implement this in software you know

128
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.900
what you call this variable name alright

129
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.990
one thing you could do is in in Tison

130
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.820
you can write you know give us a very

131
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.040
long variable name ID final output of

132
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.860
all over a diva but that's a very long

133
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.420
variable name you could call this a get

134
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.380
DJ d bar but because you're always

135
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.530
taking derivatives respect to DJ respect

136
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.420
to this final output variable I'm going

137
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.820
to introduce a new notation we're in

138
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.610
code when you are computing this thing

139
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.12
um in the code you write we're just

140
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.840
going to use the variable name d VAR in

141
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.810
order to represent that quantity okay so

142
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.870
d VAR in the code you write will

143
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.450
represent the derivative of the final

144
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.310
output variables you care about such as

145
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.490
J or sometimes the loss L with respect

146
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.710
to the various intermediate quantities

147
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.500
in computing in your code so this thing

148
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.370
here in your codes you know you use them

149
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.160
DV to denote this value so DV would be

150
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.290
equal to 3 and your cold you

151
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.660
representatives as on da right which is

152
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.960
a we also figured out to be equal to 3

153
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.620
okay so um with Sun back propagation

154
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.160
partially through this computation graph

155
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.620
let's go through the rest of this

156
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.470
example on the next slide so let's go to

157
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.560
a cleaned up copy of the computation

158
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.650
graph and just to recap what we've done

159
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.680
so far is go backward here and figured

160
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.160
out that DV is equal to 3 the gain the

161
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.960
definition of DV that's just the

162
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.090
variable name of the code is really DJ

163
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.560
DV I will figured out that D a is equal

164
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.410
to 3 and again da is the variable name

165
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.090 
in your code and that's really the value

166
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.040
of DJ

167
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:50.020
da and what sort of hand wave how you

168
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.120
know we've gone backwards on these two

169
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.360
edges like so now let's keep computing

170
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.330
derivatives or let's look at the value

171
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:03.610
you so what is DJ vu well through a

172
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.380
similar calculation is what we did

173
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.550
before and we start off with u equals 6

174
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.740
if you bump up you to the 6.01

175
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.820
then V which is previous 11 goes up to

176
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.800
11 point over 1 and so J goes from 33 -

177
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.370
33 point 0 3 and so the increase in J is

178
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.940
3 X so this is equal and the analysis

179
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.010
that U is very similar to the analysis

180
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.310
we did for a this is actually computed

181
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:42.430
as a DJ DV x DV d you wear this we had

182
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.750
already figured out was 3 and this turns

183
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.600
out to be equal to 1 so we've kind of

184
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.089
one more step back application we end up

185
00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:57.700
computing that D U is also equal to 3

186
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.020
and D U is of course just as DJ gu now

187
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.899
we just step through one last example in

188
00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:09.190
detail so what is DJ DP right so you

189
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.230
imagine if you are allowed to change the

190
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.750
value of B and you want to tweak be a

191
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.959
little bit in order to minimize or

192
00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.149
maximize the value of J alright so what

193
00:10:19.149 --> 00:10:20.950
is the derivative what's the slope of

194
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.190
this function J when you change the

195
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.160
value of B a little bit it turns out

196
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.950
that using the chain rule for calculus

197
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.800
this can be written as the product of

198
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.970
two things is DG j vu times d u DB and

199
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.850
the reasoning is if you change be a

200
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.170
little bit so b goes from 3 to say the

201
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.230
point 0 1 um the way of no effect Jane

202
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.380
is it will first affect you so how much

203
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.100
does it affect you well U is defined as

204
00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.190
B times C right so this will go from six

205
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:08.290
when B is equal to 3/2 now our 6.00 to

206
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:13.180
right because C is equal to 2 in our

207
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.320
example here and so this tells us that

208
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.800
PUD B is equal to 2 because when you

209
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.100
pump up B by point O 1 you increase this

210
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.690
twice as much so d UD b this is equal to

211
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.010
2 and now we know that U has gone up

212
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.620
twice as much as B has gone up

213
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.880
well once DJ D you we've already figured

214
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.850
out that this is equal to 3 and so by

215
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.040
multiplying these two out we find that

216
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.520 
DJ DB is equal to 6 and again

217
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.320
here's the reasoning for the second part

218
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.480
of the argument which is we want to know

219
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.570
when you goes up by point over to how

220
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.190
does that affect J the fact that DJ D U

221
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.250
is equal to 3 that tells us that when

222
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.120
you goes up by point zero two J goes up

223
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.460
three times as much so J should go up by

224
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:16.360
0.06 right so so bill that's comes from

225
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.390
in fact that DJ d u is equal to three

226
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.240
and if you check the map in detail you

227
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.810
will find that if B becomes three point

228
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.060
zero one then you become six point zero

229
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:35.380
two V becomes 11.0 - all right so that's

230
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.330
a plus u so this 5 Plus u and then J

231
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.790
which is equal to 3 times V then ends up

232
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.080
being equal to 33 point zero zero six

233
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.960
right and so that's how you get that DK

234
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.740
DB is equal to 6 and to fill that in

235
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.130 
this is if we go backwards so this is DB

236
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.970
is equal to 6 and DD really is the

237
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.830
Python code variable name for you know

238
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.209
DJ dB

239
00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:06.949
and I won't I won't go through the last

240
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:08.929
example in great detail but it turns out

241
00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:13.939
that if you also computes out DJ da this

242
00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:21.470
turns out to be DJ b u times d u da and

243
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.720
this turns out to be ninth it turns out

244
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.720
these three times three I won't go

245
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.339
through that example in detail Pacelle

246
00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:30.559
through this last step you know it is

247
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:35.379
possible to derive that B C is equal to

248
00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:38.569
so the key takeaway from this video from

249
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:40.519
this example is that when computing

250
00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.110
derivatives in computing all of these

251
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.959
derivatives the most efficient way to do

252
00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:47.110
so is through a right-to-left

253
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.579
computation following the direction of

254
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.740
the event arrows and in particular we'll

255
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.689
first compute the derivative respect to

256
00:13:53.689 --> 00:13:56.720
B and then that becomes useful for

257
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.579
computing the derivative respect to a

258
00:13:58.579 --> 00:14:01.040
and the derivative with respect to U and

259
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.459
then the derivative respect to u for

260
00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:09.139
example this term for example this term

261
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:11.269
over here and this term over here those

262
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:13.220
in turn become useful for computing to

263
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.629
their servers going to be in the

264
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:17.329
director of respect to C so that was a

265
00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:19.730
computation drop and how there's a

266
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.339
forward or left to right calculation to

267
00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:25.189
compute the cost function such as JD you

268
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:27.799
might want to optimize and a backward or

269
00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:30.709
a right to left calculation to compute

270
00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:33.259
derivatives if you're not familiar with

271
00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:35.509
calculus or the chain rule I know some

272
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:36.799
of those details would have gone by

273
00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:38.990
really quickly but you didn't follow all

274
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.790
the details don't worry about it in the

275
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.579
next video we'll go for this again in

276
00:14:43.579 --> 00:14:45.350
the context of logistic regression and

277
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.569
show you exactly what you need to do in

278
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:49.819
order to implement the computations you

279
00:14:49.819 --> 00:14:51.649
need to compute the derivatives of the

280
00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:54.910
logistic regression model
